# Ernest's Developer Portfolio

## About the portfolio

This portfolio allows users to see developed web pages and developer implementations such as HTML CSS and Java Script. Here we will be see clean and accessible code.

I utilized semantic HTML elements and made sure the code is presented in a logical structure. The navigational tabs in the header are able to jump to their corresponding sections. I added alt tags for all broken images on the page. I've commented both the CSS and HTML source code. All the code is positioned correctly and displaying accurate information without breaking.

I am certain the HTML and CSS for this project is clean and more accessible. I'm sure it meets the best practices of full stack developers today.
