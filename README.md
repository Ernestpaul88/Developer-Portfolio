# Ernest's Developer Portfolio

## About the portfolio

This portfolio allows users to see developed web pages and developer implementations such as HTML CSS and Java Script. Here we will be see clean and accessible code.

I utilized semantic HTML elements and made sure the code is presented in a logical structure. The URL tabs in the header are able to jump to their corresponding sections. I added alt tags for broken images on the page. I've commented both the CSS and HTML source code. All the code is positioned correctly and displaying accurate information without breaking.

I've re-organized the CSS to display global, element, class, and used the ID selectors to easily identify groups. I removed redundant CSS and re-grouped a elements that use the same style structure. For example (All Benefit Images Display and Demensions ".benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img" All had the same CSS structure).

I am certain the HTML and CSS for this project is cleane more accessible and meets the best practices of full stack developers today.
